This program is designed for classifying earthquake-induced sand liquefaction risk based on Cone Penetration Testing data. The complete source code is provided in the accompanying Python file, while the description of the program is contained in the text file. The data used for calculations and visualizations are stored in an Excel spreadsheet.

Due to the large size of the packaged software, it has been divided into two compressed packages. After downloading both packages, you can unzip them and run the program. Please note that the software may experience a brief delay when opening. Kindly wait for more than ten seconds for it to load fully.
