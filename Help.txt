        Instructions for the Earthquake Sandy Soil Liquefaction Risk Index Rating Program Based on Static Cone Penetration Test

        I. Program Overview
        This program is used to calculate and evaluate the possibility of sandy soil liquefaction under earthquake action and its rating, based on the data of static cone penetration test (CPT).

        II. Description of Input Parameters
        1. Measured Cone Tip Resistance (MPa): The cone tip resistance value obtained from the static cone penetration test.
        2. Groundwater Level Depth (m): The depth of the groundwater level at the test point.
        3. Peak Ground Acceleration (g): The peak ground acceleration during the earthquake.
        4. Surface Wave Magnitude Ms: The surface wave magnitude of the earthquake.
        5. Friction Ratio: The ratio of the cone tip resistance to the sidewall frictional resistance.
        6. Liquefaction Layer Thickness (m): The thickness of the soil layer that may liquefy.
        7. Middle Depth of Liquefaction Layer (m): The middle depth of the liquefaction layer.

        III. Operation Steps
        1. Add Test Point: Click the "Add New Point" button.
        2. Add Soil Layer: Click the "Add New Layer" button under each test point.
        3. Input Parameters: Enter the parameters of each soil layer in the corresponding input boxes.
        4. Calculate Results: Click the "Calculate Liquefaction Level" button to obtain the calculation results.

        IV. Result Explanation
        1. Contribution Value: The contribution of each soil layer to the overall liquefaction possibility.
        2. Point Liquefaction Index: The comprehensive liquefaction possibility index of each soil layer.
        3. Liquefaction Level: The level of liquefaction (No Liquefaction, Slight Liquefaction, Moderate Liquefaction, Severe Liquefaction) divided according to the liquefaction index.

        V. Import and Export
        1. Import: Click the "Import Excel File" button to import the pre-prepared test data.
        2. Export: Click the "Export Results" button to export the calculation results as an Excel file.

        VI. Notes
        1. All input parameters should be valid numbers.
        2. The minimum value of the friction ratio is 0.4.
        3. Ensure that all necessary parameters are entered before calculation.
